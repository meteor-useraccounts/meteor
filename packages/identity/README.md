# identity

Meteor's user identity system. This package implements the basic functions
necessary to establish identities and lets other packages register identity
services.

The `identity-login-method` package can be used to establish identities using
login methods like `Meteor.loginWith<service>`.

## Status

This is a work in progress. It is not yet suitable for use on production
systems.

## Documentation
